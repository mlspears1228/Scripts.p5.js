# Scripts.p5.js
Python scripts that should make p5.js devolpment easier

## ImageByPixels.py
Given the location of an image file, generates a text file that can be copy and pasted into p5.js.
Includes pushing and popping with correct rectangle mode and filling and rectangle drawing.

## Planned additions

### ImageByPixels.py
- Lower the amount of lines of code the script generates.
- Create a javascript file instead of a text file that can be easily added to p5.js projects
